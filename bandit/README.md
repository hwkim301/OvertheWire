**Bandit** is a Linux wargame. 


There are many writeups online, but most of them just show the solutions(commands) and not really explain what the commands mean and why you need to execute those commands.


So I decided to publish a detailed writeup.


You should know some basic terminal commands like `ls`, `cat`, `gzip`, however you can still follow along my writeups. 


It will be a bit hard ady might take more time than those who know linux terminal commands. 

For writeups I recommend watching [Anyascii's writeup videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GXCqqdbzFM&list=PLDeiu_UsIPZaCf6zTvcQNOmLF7alb2J9R).


She does a really good job explaining, the only downside of her writeups is that the volume is a bit small, you need to increase the volume when playing the videos.
